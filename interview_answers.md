# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?

A stateful component is one that uses state to initial variables and functions. A functional component may or may not use state.

2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?

The componentWillMount function is called when the page is successfully rendered to the DOM. The componentWillUpdate function is called anytime state or variables are updated.

3. Define stateful logic.

Stateful logic is any code or hooks that use state to initialize values.

4. What are the three step of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?

Arrange, Act, Assert. In 'arrange' you grab all of the elements from the DOM that you want to assess. In 'act' you simulate user events on those elements. In 'assert' you check that the user event had the outcome you desired.
